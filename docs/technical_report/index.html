			<h2>Problem Presentation</h2>
			<p>Our current student portal at FCS (FII), lacks integration with its various services for students. Students cannot login
				on the main page or access a dashboard-like view. The existing website does not respond to the needs of the students
				since a lot of the online services are non-existent - they require direct contact with the staff. Other issues include
				problems with the schedule and the student course selection, as not all options are displayed or optional course selection
				is not always clear. Furthermore, a lot of the existing course information, such as exams, documentation or even materials
				are not all congregated in the same place. Seeing as the university has an increasing number new students, and this is
				their main portal, a lot of these issues cause people to no longer access the webpage and seek information via other
				means, such as Facebook, and end up misinformed, or end up bothering the staff with trivial questions about things such
				as the schedule.</p>
		</section>
		<section typeof="sa:MaterialsAndMethods" id="motivation">
			<h2>State-of the Art</h2>
			<p>If we are to consider some of the best student portals that exist, we should have a look at british universities. They’ve
				basically stamped out a certain design and functionality pattern for their main pages, while each of them has managed,
				in time, to rebuild and integrate their initial functionality, such as course scheduling or enrollment features. By having
				a look at student portals like Oxford, http://www.ox.ac.uk/ , Manchester, http://www.manchester.ac.uk/ , Cardiff, https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/
				, universities have a similar design, where they combine the elements of Enrollment, Existing Students Intranet, News/Information,
				Business/Research and finally Site Map & Search. Having done so, this allows clear navigation through the existing services.
				And while some may link to some more outdated internal web-pages, having a clear cut pattern, helps solve many of existing
				users issues. They also have created certain levels of access for staff later on, as to allow professors to view grade
				students, or the creation of other services that may become necessary in the future. As such, when compared to our initial
				problem, we have a clear cut method of improving our current features and we have an organisation method presented to
				us. It is also good to note, that, while UK universities do put an accent on presentation, german/swiss uni, tend to
				take a more functional design, but keep much of the elements mentioned above. Below: Calendar Schedule for a week for
				a student.</p>

			<h2>Our solution</h2>
			<p>Our solution was the creation of a .NET application that is based on various microservices using C#. This allows us, or
				anyone in the future to work and create his own microservice for the existing application that adds various features
				and functionalities to the website. Our current system allows us to make user accounts and stay logged in using a token
				system for two hours. We can see the current course list, that is attributed to our current year, and have a schedule
				displayed to us, based on those courses. The course list is going to be generated, by parsing the current existing webpage
				and adding them to a database. The same will be done with the existing schedule. Though currently there is no difference
				between user types, this can be added as later functionality. Strictly speaking the current solution is the bareback
				bones structure that can be used to later build upon other functions.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="file-headers">
			<h2>Results, Evaluation</h2>
			<p>Currently our application runs smoothly and collects information from the other websites of the university. Two process
				parse the existing information in the schedule and the existing courses and create a database that is put to use as part
				of the application. Since it was thought out as a modular application, we can extend its current functionality, and parse
				other information, having a flexible working model, that integrates old existing elements. It is secured using authentication
				and authorization with JWT, currently users having tokens generated for each session that lasts two hours.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="file-headers">
			<h2>Server side results</h2>
			<p>In order to implement the microservice architecture we need a structure that combines and manages communication between
				modules. This is represented by the server. In order to achieve these results we built the two main components of the
				server:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a communication layer</li>
				<li>a reusable HTTP client.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The first one (communication layer) provides an endpoint to an existing client application for getting functionality that
				is built on the microservice layer. Also, it offers a data exchange mechanism between microservices, increasing decoupling
				in the way that no microservice is dependent on other microservice. In order to implement the communication layer we
				composed a HTTP client. It is used for providing a generic tool that helps the server module and also the microservices
				to send their requests. This includes multiple types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE). In the end, we
				managed to build a server side component in a SOLID manner that is able to handle all the client requests. The workflow
				pattern contains requesting other microservices for providing specific data and also resolving the requests received
				from the microservices.</p>
			<p>

			<h2>Timetable Solution</h2>
			<p>The timetable module is part of the microservice architecture designed at a project level. This module is separated from
				all the other modules and returns isolated data. The desired behaviour of this module is to parse the online timetable
				available for all the groups of students and return the data in a reusable object oriented model. The business requirement
				was met by creating a parser as the core of this module which receives a timetable request with basic data like: e.g.
				group, year. Based on this request type and the type of response wanted (e.g. day timetable, week timetable) the parser
				requests the content from the online table. Then the content is parsed and is mapped into an appropriate data structure
				taking into account the structure from the online timetable.After the parsing is done, the completed data structure is
				sent to the controller which in turn communicates with the server or other external consumers. In this way this module
				is completely decoupled from the other functionalities and has a single responsibility.</p>

			<h2>Comparison with other solutions</h2>
			<p>Further research is necessary at this stage due to the alpha stage of the application and lack of friendly user interface
				which allows us to compare the user experience between different solutions. At a feature level, our architecture allows
				us to extend the functionality very easily which is an advantage over other tightly coupled solutions.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="file-headers">
			<h2>Future work</h2>
			<p>As at this stage this is purely theoretical, but with the current way the application is build, we can progress in a manner
				of directions and create a wide variety of microservices for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Secretary Work - Contracts/Paperwork/PaymentsStudent Enrollment</li>
				<li>Scheduling Appointments</li>
				<li>Dissertation/Research and Thesis Work - Applying/Proposing/Referencing</li>
				<li>Publishing/Archiving Work</li>
				<li>Intranet - Professor Course Storage</li>
				<li>Online Exams or Assignment Submission</li>
				<li>Partnerships (since our university has loads of connection to companies)</li>
				<li>Foreign Students Portal</li>
				<li>...and others</li>
			</ul>
			<p>But we mentioned a wide variety of things that CAN be done. But since the required work for such an arduous task would
				require an entire team, having an outline of what can be done, is just as important in order to have a idea of which
				direction work should progress in. As the program will be developed throughout the next year, we can take our time and
				make various choices.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>As presented earlier, the project developed this semester is only the first step towards an application which will be
				fully integrated in the students’ life. By starting with a fully modular and reusable infrastructure, we can easily extend
				the existing platform in the future, being able to scale up to almost all requirements which might appear. The microservice-ready
				architecture will guarantee that at any time we will be able to migrate to fully independent microservices. This is crucial,
				since we might not be the ones developing this application in the future: it is easily extensible, without breaking the
				already existing functionality. The next logical step in the development of this product will be to create an interactive
				user interface, with a rich user experience. This will require study of already existing applications in this area, to
				see which approach is the best when it comes to student portals. However, we will keep in mind the way our students use
				the portal that is available right now, and start building up a better experience from there. In conclusion, we strive
				to give our colleagues at FCS a friendlier approach to all the tools provided by our faculty, in an intuitive and friendly
				experience.
